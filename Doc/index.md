"This is a triubute to Toru Iwatani's original Pacman of 1980 by two students"


  - **Introduction**

  Pac-Man is a classic arcade game developed by Toru Iwatani and released by Namco in 1980. The game features a yellow character navigating a maze, eating pellets, and avoiding ghosts. It's a timeless, iconic game that has left a significant mark on pop culture. Our team has created a small tribute to this legendary classic.
